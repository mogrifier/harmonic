fractal music - mostly sounds really bad
repetition and scale
recall a fractal is truly NOT the same at various iteration, but close, so music should vary. Not truly symmetric, either.

mapping a set to music- how?

what about using music to drive fractal? (slow on computer, but could render later)

mapping other data to music?

GOES data
solar wind

what is data turned into? midi? raw audio? (could use fp32 to handle dynamic range)
spectral coefficients for conversion to audio? (reverse FFT or for manipulating and summing sin wave >
additive synthesis. 
Most interesting to choose frequency of sine wave and apply data to amplitude and add up and normalize it all.
Use UI to change base frequencies in use. Harmonic synthesis driven by external data.
bound data first so you don't have crazy peaks in one range.
A log function could be good for bounding inputs. log base 10 essential gives you the x in 10^x for value. compresses the range nicely. 

proff of concept. generate audio file using sin formula. play back. does it work? now add in different frequencies. 


running k-means on a set of syex patches. anything meaningful? if I do see clusters, then opens up chance of creating new sysex patches and trying to fit to the clusters. mathematically close.

what pre-processing is needed? I think the binary just has to a be a csv. simple.

also need a sysex validator (ranges).

Is pure java faster than processing for fractals? worth finding out. 


mapping function for unknown range of inputs requires something like Modulo math (other options?)

input the value to a function that produces a bound output (then normalize as needed)
roll your own (like fractal divergence to infinity) or use some fancy math

linear normalization may be insufficient since values will cluster. How to spread out uniformly? Trig may be best.


geometric functions (sin, tan, cos, etc) are bounded depending on some rules
e^(1/x) is bound for x >= 1
complex sin is bounded

f(x) = 1/(x^2 + 1) is bounded for all x

f(x) = 1/(x^2 - 1) is bound for [2, +inf] and [-2, -inf]
